/**
 * Log-text triggers
 *
 * Pure detectors for secret codes, keywords and emojis that the user
 * can sneak into a log entry to toggle System modes. Keeping this
 * module pure (no stores, no DOM) so tests and non-Log surfaces can
 * reuse it. Wiring into the actual stores happens at the call site.
 *
 * Design rules:
 *  - Detectors are case-insensitive for keywords, exact for emojis.
 *  - Each detector must be idempotent — returning `true` does not
 *    mean the trigger fires twice if the user edits around it; the
 *    call site is responsible for debouncing via "last seen" refs.
 *  - Triggers are additive: a single log can contain several.
