- Show you remember what they told you - use phrases like "You mentioned...", "Since you prefer...", "Last time you chose...", "Building on your answer about..."
- The question should feel like you're having an ongoing conversation, not starting fresh each time
- Make connections between their different answers to show you understand their overall lifestyle

**Examples of good follow-up questions:**
- "Since you mentioned enjoying tea in the morning, how do you usually prepare it?" (Options: Quick tea bag, Loose leaf ritual, Matcha ceremony)
- "You chose 'Fresh salad' for lunch earlier. What's your go-to salad base?" (Options: Mixed greens, Spinach, Arugula)
- "Last time you said you prefer comfortable outfits. What fabrics feel best to you?" (Options: Soft cotton, Linen, Merino wool)

1. Start with a brief introductory paragraph (1-2 sentences)
2. Add a blank line after the introduction
3. Write "Key insights into their daily routines and preferences include:"
4. Add a blank line
5. List key insights using "–" (en dash, not bullet points or hyphens) at the start of each line
6. Ensure each insight is a complete sentence
7. Do not use asterisks, bullets (•), or other symbols - only the en dash (–)

Example format:
This user is [brief description of their personality/situation].

Key insights into their daily routines and preferences include:

– They enjoy [specific preference with details].

– They prioritize [habit or routine], engaging in it [frequency].

– They have [characteristic or goal], using [method or approach].`
